# FairAssign
This repository contains implementation of the FairAssign algorithm defined in our paper titled "Stochastically Fair Driver Assignment in Last Mile Delivery: From E-comm to Food Platforms", 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local mahcine.

### Pre-requisites
The algorithms are implemented in Python 3 (Python 3.9)     
For solving the linear programs, the following LP Solvers will be needed: [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/) and [IBM Cplex](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio)
