# FairAssign
Codebase for our work titled ["FairAssign: Stochastically Fair Driver Assignment in Gig Delivery Platforms"] (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3594040) (FAccT 2023)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local mahcine.

### Pre-requisites
The algorithms are implemented in Python 3 (Python 3.9)     
For solving the linear programs, the following LP Solvers will be needed: [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/) and [IBM Cplex](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio)

### Installation 
Setup a conda environment using the environment.yml file
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fair_assign
```
